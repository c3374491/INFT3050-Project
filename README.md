## Can I use external code?
In some cases, yes you are permitted to use external code. However, any code used must comply with the following requirements:
1. It must be referenced in your Report and Code
2. It must NOT be more than 10% of your overall Code
3. It must NOT come from ChatGPT or similar software.

See below for more information.

***Lecture/Lab Material***
If you use code from another source, other than the lecture and lab materials, you must clearly. indicate which parts you have written, and which are from another source. This is done by adding a comment before and after the block of sourced code indicating the where the code was sourced from, the code's author and a reason for using the code in your project.

***ChatGPT***
Code generated from ChatGPT is NOT permitted in this assignment. NO part of this assessment item should be generated from ChatGPT or other AI-Based software/s.

***Online Code from Stack overflow etc.***
This code is permitted but it must be referenced and cannot be more than 10% of your build. Code that does not conform to this style may be assumed to be the work of someone else.
If you use code from another source without clearly referencing it or if you use ChatGTP or similar systems, you will be investigated for academic misconduct.
